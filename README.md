SpreeUnifaunExport
==================

This extension allows you to export addresses that you can see in the Orders view in the admin panel. It was made for an export for the Unifaun system but it's standard tab-delimited csv, so it would be easy to adapt it to a different need.

Installation
------------

Add spree_unifaun_export to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_unifaun_export', github: 'ridem/spree_unifaun_export', branch: '3-0-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
